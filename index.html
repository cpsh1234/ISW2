<h2>What is the TSR MHoC?</h2>
    <p>The MHoC is a model House of Commons, that means that we play politics and pretend to run a country. This test is disigned to help sort people into parties. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each party, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the Parties values?</h2>
    <p>There are five independent parties at the moment - Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Libertarian, and Citizens</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff0000;">Labour</b><br/>
        Those in the Labour Party tend to be the most left wing, especially as there is no other left wing party in the MHoC currently.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0000ff;">Conservative</b><br/>
        Those in the Conservative Party tend to socially conservative. They tend to support lower taxes, privatization, deregulation.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffff00;">Liberal Democrat</b><br/>
        Those in the Liberal Democrats tend to be socially liberal, although can have authoritarian ways of pushing these policies. They are often to the left of center</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff9100;">Libertarian</b><br/>
        Those in the Libertarian are generally classical liberals. They believe in having a small state and want taxes to be as low as possible. </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff00ff;">Citizen</b><br/>
        Those in the Citizens Party believe in strong civil liberties. They tend to support democracy centerism, taking what they would call a pragmatic approach to politics.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
